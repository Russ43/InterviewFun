# Problem
## Problem Statement
Implement the atoi function. The [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atoi/](atoi function)
was popular in C libraries and is short for "int to ASCII."
The basic idea is to convert a string (eg: "123") to an integer (eg: 123).

Like the C function, leading whitespace should be ignored. For example, "  123" should return 123.

Unlike the C function, invalid arguments should result in an appropriate exception being thrown to adhere
to .NET guidelines. For example, "12YQ_43" should cause a FormatException to be thrown and
"123456789101112" should causing an OverflowException to be thrown.

## Givens
You are given an IAtoi interface with "Atoi" method.
